								 Our Ancestry Service helps you understand who you are, where your DNA comes from and your family story. We analyze, compile

								Human DNA is about 99.5% identical from person to person. However, there are small differences that make each person unique.
								These differences are called variants.

								Our CLIA-certified lab extracts DNA from cells in your saliva sample. Then the lab processes the DNA on a genotyping chip
